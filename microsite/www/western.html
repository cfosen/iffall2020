        <h3>Jalisco</h3>
        <p>
            The Jarabe is considered Mexico's “national dance” and is the best known outside the country, often called the “Mexican Hat Dance” in English. The dance was performed for the first time formally in 1860 at the Coliseo Theater in Mexico City. During the 1860s it was fashionable in high society.The dance symbolizes the courtship of a woman by a man, who at first is refused but accepted in the end. The two protagonists are usually a man in a charro suit and a woman in a “China Poblana” outfit. It was popularized internationally in the 20th century by Russian dancer Anna Pavlova who visited Mexico in 1919. She made the dance part of her permanent repertoire. The dance's current form emerged nationally during the Mexican Revolution although various “jarabe” dances existed before this time, such as the Jarabe Jalisco, the Jarabe Atole and Jarabe Moreliana. The charros outfit is from Mexico's cowboy tradition and the China Poblana outfit is based on the dress of an Asian woman who became famous in the city of Puebla in the colonial period. Today, this dress, especially the skirt, is heavily decorated with patriotic themes. The Jarabe is danced to Mariachi music and is performed at Mexican national holidays such as Las Fiestas Patrias, Cinco de Mayo, and El Diez Seis de Septiembre.

On the day of the festival, they form a procession with the guardian of the horse's head in front on a wooden horse. Pescados (Fish) is performed mostly in Guerrero by participants acting as fishermen with nets and with those that play the part of fish who are identified by small wooden fish that hang from their shoulders. There is one other character which is a lizard, who is covered with a wooden frame that opens and closes its mouth. It also carries some barbed wire which it used to try to hit the fishermen.
