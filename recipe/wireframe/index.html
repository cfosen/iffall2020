        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Roll beef heavily in flour and then brown them in butter in a large stock pot. Add 1 cup of water, Worcester sauce and molasses to the meat and cook for 30 min. Then, add the rest of the ingredients. Simmer for several hours. After cooking for 2-3 hours, take one cup of broth from the pot and add cornstarch, then slowly add back to the pot to thicken.
